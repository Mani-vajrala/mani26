    <h1>What is Climate Change?</h1>
    <p>Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. While Earth's climate has changed throughout its history, recent human activity is causing it to warm at an unprecedented rate. Greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, are released into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial activities, leading to a “greenhouse effect” that traps heat within the Earth’s atmosphere.</p>

    <h2>Causes of Climate Change</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Burning Fossil Fuels:</strong> The burning of coal, oil, and natural gas for energy releases carbon dioxide (CO2), the leading greenhouse gas.</li>
      <li><strong>Deforestation:</strong> Trees absorb CO2, but widespread deforestation releases stored carbon into the atmosphere.</li>
      <li><strong>Agricultural Practices:</strong> Livestock farming, rice paddies, and the use of synthetic fertilizers release methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), potent greenhouse gases.</li>
      <li><strong>Industrial Processes:</strong> Factories and industrial operations release various greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Consequences of Climate Change</h2>
    <p>Climate change is already having devastating effects on our planet:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Rising Sea Levels:</strong> As glaciers and ice caps melt, the volume of water in oceans rises, threatening coastal cities and island nations.</li>
      <li><strong>Increased Extreme Weather:</strong> The frequency and intensity of extreme weather events—such as heatwaves, storms, and floods—are increasing.</li>
      <li><strong>Biodiversity Loss:</strong> Changing climates and habitats are threatening thousands of species with extinction.</li>
      <li><strong>Food Security:</strong> Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns are affecting crop yields, which could lead to food shortages.</li>
    </ul>
