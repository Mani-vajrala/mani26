  <!-- Introduction to Climate Change -->
  <section class="intro">
    <h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>
    <p>Climate change refers to long-term changes in the temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric conditions on Earth. The current climate crisis is driven by human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes that release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This results in global warming, rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and disruptions to ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
